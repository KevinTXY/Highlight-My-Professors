Looking for the best teacher for a gen ed? Maybe you're registering late and all the well known professors are taken? Highlight My Professors is a rapid solution for looking up professor ratings and finding the *right* teacher. Simply highlight any teachers name with our chrome plugin enabled, and we'll give you their [ratemyprofessors](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) information!

## How does it work?
After highlighting a professor's name, a request is sent to our Python webscraper hosted on the Google Cloud platform. This returns relevant ratemyprofessors information back to you. It's quick, it's clean, and it pops up on your screen.
